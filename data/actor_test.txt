here's a concept -- jean-claude $T$ gets killed within the first ten minutes of the movie 
jean-clause van damme

 now if that isn't enough to get you to finally see a $T$ movie , i don't know what is 
jean-clause van damme

 $T$ #1 works for the russian mafia in the united states and is killed by some of their operatives 
jean-clause van damme

 $T$ #2 is a police officer in france who finds out that he had a twin brother he never knew about after #1 gets killed in france

 this is the typical $T$ movie , with jean-claude doing a variety of high end martial arts moves on his opponents 
jean-clause van damme
-1
 nothing new here , and certainly nothing we haven't seen in every other $T$ movie 
jean-clause van damme

 this is pretty much like every movie that $T$ has ever been involved in -- sub par 
jean-clause van damme

 once there , he hooks up with his deceased brother's girlfriend , played by $T$ , and the two of them set out to discover who the murderers are 
natasha henstridge

 on the upside , $T$ is in this film , and she does what she did best in species -- she gets naked

 it features a cookie-cutter " i-wanna-please-dada " rameses , who at least is given dignity by the voicework of $T$ ( from schindler's list , among other things ) 
Ralph Fiennes
1
 the film also features an extremely annoying character by way of the " new-improved " miriam , voiced by the ever-antsy $T$ , even though the most irritating thing about her is her tendency to burst into song for no apparent reason ( here bullock is replaced by a singing voice ) 
Sandra Bullock

it certainly didn't look that way from the outset , which introduces groom-to-be ben holmes ( $T$ ) at his bachelor party , surrounded by friends and family whooping over his " last night of freedom

Jet Li
1
critique : very cool !now here's a movie that gives you exactly what you're looking for , if what you're looking for is kickass action , a palpable good cop/bad cop story line , some hardcore stunts and $T$ slam-dunking everyone in sight !the film also moves fast ( a mere 95 minutes ) , develops a certain " cute " chemistry between fonda and li , has nice surroundings ( paris , baby ! ) and gives us one of the best bad guys that i've seen all year 
Jet Li
1
anyway , other than him , $T$ also handled his " acting " pretty well in this film , with very little real dialogue to say , but enough to make us believe his character 
Jet Li
1
we go to see $T$ movies because we want to see $T$ kicking a lot of ass from side to side , and this film delivers gangbusters on that front 
Jet Li
1
one thing that i would definitely recommend is , as $T$ pointed out himself on his website , that you leave the kids at home for this one

adam sandler
1
the reason i say it's not really $T$'s best work is because it gets really sappy towards the end of a movie , showing some odd feelings that somehow didn't really belong in a $T$ vehicle 
adam sandler

i mean , it fits the movie's tone and everything , and $T$ handles it well , but it's just oddly placed , that's all

of course , nothing in the film screams 1970s more than the casting of pam grier and $T$ as the two leads , and although the caper intrigue is fun to watch as the plot twists , backstabbing , and deceptions deliciously unfold , the strength of jackie brown is the quiet , understated relationship developed between jackie and max ; when they kiss , it's perhaps the most tender scene of the year 
robert forster

 $T$'s nuanced , understated performance is the best in the film ; he creates an amiable character of such poignancy that when he gazes at jackie , we smile along with him

nicolas $T$ is seth , a guardian angel who , like hundreds ( likely thousands or even millions ) of other angels , spends eternity watching over the citizens of mortality ; humans never aware of how much celestial intervention occurs in their life

$T$ is a wonderfully versatile actor ( think face/off , raising arizona , and it could happen to you - what a combo ! ) who slips into the role of a heavenly agent quite nicely but threatens sappiness more than once

$T$ , in her most subdued performance yet , plays maggie , a doctor who begins to ponder exactly who it is we're fighting against when we fight to keep someone alive

it's nice to see $T$ pick up roles like this and the one in courage under fire 
meg ryan
1
the two aren't very comparable to each other , but they both deviate from her usual " intelligently ditzy " romantic comedy roles , and it's an impressive side of $T$ movie goers rarely have the chance to enjoy 
meg ryan

but even though the two leads do an impressive job , it is $T$ who grabs us with his interpretation of a hospital patient who knows more than meets the eye

 the film opens in a quaint cornish seaside village at the funeral of the husband of a middle-aged woman , grace ( $T$ ) , who fell out of an airplane , evidently committing suicide 
Brenda blethyn
1
 there are a lot of silly giggles that come forth and the film has just enough of an acting performance by $T$ to breathe air into it before it comes to its belated finale , as it drones on with its transparently gratuitous upbeat tone , until it makes the audience feel good that the sweet old lady succeeded 
Brenda blethyn

 the film moves into the formula mode , whereas grace beats the odds against her failing to survive , as she meets an international drug dealer , a frenchman ( $T$ ) , who is first seen threatening to cut off her fingers but later becomes her business partner and husband as she becomes a millionaire and writes a best selling fiction book about her experiences , thereby becoming a celebrity

synopsis : investigator ichabod crane journeys to 1799 s$T$py hollow to investigate a series of murders involving decapitation 
christopher lee
1
s$T$py hollow , his newest feature which fans have been anticipating for a while , shares the similar dark and atmospheric style of his earlier work and counts among his better movies 
christopher lee
1
s$T$py hollow quite obviously draws its inspiration from the old period horror films of the 1950s and 1960s , especially hammer studios' reworkings of dracula and frankenstein , and american international's series of movies based on the works of edgar allan poe 
christopher lee
1
$T$ , in fact , star of many hammer productions over the years , appears at the beginning of s$T$py hollow as a judge who sends ichabod crane out to investigate the murders 
christopher lee
1
one of the few weak parts of s$T$py hollow is the wooden and cliched dialogue between the main characters 
christopher lee
1
walker is quickly becoming one of the premiere suspense writers in hollywood , and s$T$py hollow certainly doesn't hurt his growing reputation 
christopher lee
1
as one might imagine from a gentleman like walker , s$T$py hollow is quite graphic 
christopher lee
1
if you're looking for a good scare , however , s$T$py hollow is definately recommended

 here lies another crucial flaw in the story : doesn't anyone realize you can copy a tape ? oh well , no one ever said $T$ movies had to make sense 
jackie chan
-1
 as luck would have it , diana runs across $T$ , and , wouldn't you know it , $T$ accidentally ends up with the tape

 this leads to countless chase and/or fight scenes which look like they could have been lifted from rumble in the bronx or nearly any other $T$ movie 
jackie chan

 however , that doesn't mean an end to the atrocious dubbing that has afflicted $T$'s recent americanized releases 
jackie chan
-1
 whether this is just a very bad case of looping , an effort to minimize accents , or a simple case of nostalgia , it does achieve the same level of distraction present in all of $T$'s dubbed films 
jackie chan
-1
 nice guy is negligible , merely an excuse to have $T$ on the run from various goons

 but even though plots have always been second to the action in $T$'s films , it seems odd that the filmmakers have stuck us with this tired retread

 look , if you have $T$ playing a chef , why not use that to your advantage ? watching $T$ doing his stuff in a kitchen , beating the bad guys with foodstuffs sounds like the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts 
jackie chan
-1
 there's really only one no holds barred fight scenes that have become the trademark of $T$'s films

-1
 it takes place in the arbitrary location of a construction site , apparently for the sole reason that there are lots of nifty things lying around that can be useful ala $T$ 
jackie chan
-1
 the action in the film is neither $T$'s best nor worst , but you long for some more inspiration in the scenes 
jackie chan

 but to slo-mo $T$ running ? either this is a nod to the six-million dollar man , or a pathetic attempt to disguise the fact that $T$ may be slowing down

it's hard enough to find a grown-up in hollywood who can give a subtle , realistic portrayal !although $T$ gets top billing , cole is really the protagonist of the story , and osment truly brings the complex kid to life

if only $T$' work were as impressive

accustomed to delivering catchphrases rather than dialogue , $T$ is stiff and awkward as malcolm , his most challenging role to date

weird things seem to happen around cole-his mother ( $T$ ) leaves the kitchen for a moment and returns to find every cabinet and drawer open even though cole hasn't moved-and cole seems to know things that a kid his age shouldn't-for example , that there was once a gallows in his school

 earth's entire existance is contingent upon a successful mission , but nobody , whether it be john's family or hired battle pilot don west ( $T$ ) , seems too enthusiastic about leaving their home planet for several years

 if you , like me , were convinced by commercials that her voice was altered for some sort of plot twist where her body would be taken over by aliens , you're wrong ! that's just her normal voice ! in yet another example of a " friend " faltering on the big screen , $T$ is so incredibly dull and yet so obviously trying so hard to be so incredibly charming ( make sense ? ) , it makes you want to shove his ass out the escape pod corridor without an escape pod

 john's family consists of his wife maureen ( $T$ ) , his atypical teenage daughter penny ( lacey chabert ) , his ingenious son will ( jack johnson ) , and his beautiful scientist daughter judy ( heather graham )

 it's hard to tell who deserves the most blame - the incredibly bland and corny characters or the horrifically lame script ? $T$ is basically the only one to overdo it , sounding like a whiny munchkin on helium

 one thing i will give the movie is that it's a complete departure for $T$

on top of that , young $T$'s stupefied reactions to each predicament is absolutely perfect in contrast with the narration

in portraying the writer as a persistent but mild-mannered young lad , $T$ has struck quite the chord

the numerous sequences that stick in one's mind include , of course , the famous department store santa scene - in which $T$ has some problems in telling old saint nick what he wants under the tree

 director antoine arqua has clearly not observed $T$'s excellent acting capabilties and simply requires him to mutter a few lines of broken english and look flash as he stands and shoots

 $T$'s trademark of twin pistol shooting is saved for the finale ( which in fairness is quite good ) and there's not even a toothpick in site

 to round up , the replacement killers is a pretty darned lame first outing for $T$

 $T$ ( a passport forger ) is dragged into the affay and also provides a lame love interest as well as being rather handy with a gun

 throw in that hunk of a guy $T$ and a cast of wacky characters and poof ! we'll have a hit on our hands ! " the replacements is a hokey mistake of a football film , a mishmash collage of one-dimensional characters , rampant stereotypes of cultures and races , cliched emotional statements of purpose , and $T$ wishing for the matrix sequel to start principal photography

 i bet it was some hotshot warner brothers agent with an dark armani suit and manicured fingernails saying , " it would be a very light comedic version of any given sunday , and we could throw in the hoosiers angle with the casting of $T$ as the tough but determined coach
