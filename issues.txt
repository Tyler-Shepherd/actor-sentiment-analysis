Some actor names in the data aren't captured because a shortened form of the name was used. For example, we may be looking for "Freddie Prinze Jr." but the review refers to him at one point as just "Prinze".



We caught some Turk results that were clearly fake, but there may be many that are false results we didn't catch.
